# Sales Performance Insights-Analyzing-Revenue-COGS-Payment-Trends-and-Customer-Impact
This repository name reflects a comprehensive approach to analyzing sales performance and insights. It covers multiple aspects of sales data, including revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), payment trends, and the impact of different customer types.

## Introduction
The retail sales dataset was provided and can be seen under the name called **supermarket_sales - project 2.csv** in the file section and I performed data analysis using SQL. The dataset contains information about various sales transactions, including product details, customer information, payment methods, and more.

## Data Analysis
The csv file was provided and the table inside the file has a dataset containing the following columns:
- Invoice ID
- Branch
- City
- Customer type
- Gender
- Product line
- Unit price
- Quantity
- Tax 5%
- Total
- Date
- Time
- Payment
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Gross margin percentage
- Gross income
- Rating
The first step I took was to create a database called Sales. After creating the Sales Database, the next step was to create a table which I named sales_data.
The Sales_data table contained the following columns with the appropriate data types.
- Invoice ID
- Branch
- City
- Customer type
- Gender
- Product line
- Unit price
- Quantity
- Tax 5%
- Total
- Date
- Time
- Payment
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Gross margin percentage
- Gross income
- Rating
